# photo-keywords

Tools for managing keywords associated with photographs.

For now, this is just the code used to harvest all of the tags from my Dougerino and Dogerino accounts on Flickr.

As described [here](http://mahugh.com/2013/04/02/my-backup-process/), I've been using Flickr to search my photos
for years. But now that I have all of my photo-description data local (including the Flickr tags as well as other
information from various sources), I'm going to merge it into a single consistent approach to tagging my photos.
Then I'll put together a simple search facility that I'll stand up where I can use it from any device.
